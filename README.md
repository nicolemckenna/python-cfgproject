# python-cfgproject
Data analysis project I created during my code first girls Python and Apps course. 

The essential requirements for the project were: 

1. Read the data from the spreadsheet
2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
3. Output the total sales across all months

I extended the project by:
 
Calculating the average sale value

Calculating the maximum and minimum sale values

Calculating if there was a profit or loss for each month and calcuating the profit/loss percentage
